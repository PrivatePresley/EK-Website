<!-- A site-specific wall painting located at The Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. The painting, <i>Deepwater Horizon (BP)</i>, wraps an image of the coastline from New York to Nova Scotia around the top of the room, inspired by an idea of sailing from one place to another; a utopian proposal for the artist to live and work with a minimal carbon footprint. The “water” is painted as hard-edge abstraction inspired by the dazzle ship camouflage of World War I. Colours are determined by names: Manhattan Blue, Come Sail Away, Less Traveled, Nova White, etc. Two disused rowboats <i>Rafts</i> spoon together in the centre of the room. Wormhole drawings hover above the coloured surface. <i>CD Worm</i> makes an appearance, as a weird pipeline between the wall and floor. -->
